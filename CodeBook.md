Code book

This code book describes the variables present in the data set produced
by completing the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course
offered by The Johns Hopkins University via coursera.org. The data were
produced by acquiring and manipulating an existing data set.

Each of the following variables will be described in full individually, but they share
many common components that are worth describing in general first. Each variable is a
mean of observations of a given measurement of a Subject's performance of an Activity.

The underlying measurements being averaged are themselves either means or standard
deviations of a time-domain signal, which describes the motion experienced by the
Subject's smartphone, either induced by the body's motion, or by gravity. These motions
are either quantified as linear accelerations, or as angular velocities; being vector
quantities, they have X, Y, and Z components, each of which is included, as well as
the vector's magnitude. The linear and angular jerks (both components and magnitudes)
were also obtained from the linear accelerations and angular velocities by derivation.
Finally, some of the above quantities had the Fast Fourier Transform applied, to obtain
frequency-domain measurements of the same quantities.

The selection of each of these parameters is codified in the variable names as follows:

	[t/f] 	t: time-domain
			f: frequency-domain
			
	[Body/Gravity]	Body: subject's body motion
					Gravity: gravitational motion
					
	[Acc/AccJerk/Gyro/GyroJerk]	Acc: linear acceleration
								AccJerk: linear jerk								
								Gyro: angular velocity								
								GyroJerk: angular jerk
				
	[Mean/Std]	Mean: mean measurement				
				Std: standard deviation measurement
				
	[X/Y/Z/Mag] X: motion vector's X component				
				Y: motion vector's Y component				
				Z: motion vector's Z component				
				Mag: motion vector's magnitude
				
NOTE: 	

		Units for the measurements below were not indicated in the original documentation.
		However, units for other unused (but comparable) measurements in the data set were
		given in units standard gravity units g = 9.80665 m/s^2, so if we are to assume, we
		assume the measurements below are in standard gravity units too. Thus jerk measurements
		would be in g/s, Fourier Transforms in g/s, and Fourier Transforms of jerks in g/s^2.
